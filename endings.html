            <p>Silent Hill 2 boasts six endings, none of which are confirmed to be canonical. Meaning, 
                all of these could be the "true" ending, depending on the player's play-style and preference.

            <p>To unlock this ending, James must not be too self-destructive and must favor Mary over Maria. This can 
                be achieved by healing quickly and keeping it in the green, listening to the entire conversation with Mary in the 
                hallway leading to the final boss, examining Mary's photo and letter multiple times, 
                and bumping into Maria and/or letting her take damage from monsters.
                <br>
                In this ending, James wants to continue living. We see him leave the town with Laura, leaving through the same graveyard 
                he passes on the way in.
            </p>
               

            <!-- Maria -->

            <br>
            <h2 id="maria">Maria</h2>
            <img src="Maria Ending.png">
            <p>This ending is unlocked if James shows a lot of attention to Maria. By spending 10+ minutes near her, protecting her 
                from monsters and not bumping into her, and not listening to the full conversation in the hallway or examining Mary's 
                photo or letter. You also don't want to heal in excess, but do not keep your health low for too long.
                <br>
                In this ending, James walks back to the car with Maria. Almost there, she coughs. James tells her, "You better do something 
                about that cough", implying that what happened to Mary will happen to Maria, and he will be the one to kill her, too.

            <p>James must act suicidal or reckless to get this ending, while also keeping a strong attachment to Mary. </p>
