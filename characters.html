            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>James Sunderland receives a letter from his wife, Mary, telling him to go to Silent Hill, to their "special place".
                When he gets there, the town is abandoned and covered in a thick fog. And Mary has been dead for three years.
            </p>
            <p>Here, I will cover the plot elements of the main story and Born From A Wish, the characters we encounter and interact with,
                the endings you can receive, and the monsters you must fight.
